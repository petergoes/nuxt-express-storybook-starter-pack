# Front end

This is our front-end app. It is a [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) app based on
an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

* [Front End Tooling](_docs/front-end-tooling.md)

## Development environment

### Requirements

* NodeJS (>=8.11)

### Installation

Clone the git repo and run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Advised Editor configuration

To ensure a consistent code style,
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)/[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and
[StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) are used for JavaScript and CSS
linting. Precommit and prepush hooks are in place to format `js`, `vue` and
`css` files.
An [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file is present to unify
indentation.

For your own sanity, and that of your co-workers, please configure your editor
accordingly!

Here you'll find links to editor integration of above mentioned tools

#### Files you can hide

To keep your file explorer as slim as possible, you can choose to not show the
following files, since you will never need to modify these files:

* `**/node_modules`: All dependencies of the project
* `**/.nuxt`: Cache files generated by Nuxt
* `**/__snapshots__`: The snapshots generated by the test runner
* `build`: The generated server build folder
* `dist`: The generated client dist folder

### npm configuration

When you install a new dependency via npm, you want to make sure you install it
with a locked down version. So instead of:

```json
// Bad example
{
  //...
  "jest": "^22.4.3"
  //...
}
```

do this:

```json
// Good example
{
  //...
  "jest": "22.4.3"
  //...
}
```

You can configure npm to do this for you by using the command:
`$ npm config set save-exact`. [Read more](https://github.com/voorhoede/npm-style-guide#use-save-exact-option)

### Running

There are a couple of commands you can use while developing.

| command               | function                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$ npm run dev`       | Start the dev server ([localhost:6992](http://localhost:6992))       |
| `$ npm run storybook` | Start the storybook server ([localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)) |
| `$ npm run test`      | Start the test runner                                                |
| `$ npm run lint`      | Lint all js, vue and css files                                       |
| `$ npm run lintfix`   | Fix all fixable issues in js, vue and css files                      |

Typically, you would run `$ npm run dev`, `$ npm run storybook` and
`$ npm run test` each in their own terminal window.
